## Tries

### Suffix Tree

__Problem:__ Given a sequence of chars S, find a subsequence q.

__Naive solution:__  
1. Run $$ length(S) \cdot length(q) $$ times of character-wise comparison. Space efficient but slow.
2. Cut S into $$ length(S) \cdot \frac{length(S)}{length(q)} $$ pieces of keys and put them in a HashTable. Quick but spatially not efficient.  

__Suffix Array -> Suffix Tree:__  

[Suffix Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array) can be constructed by special algorithm in linear time. With this data structure, which costs the same space as the input, we can do a binary search to find the target in $$ length(q) \cdot \log{length(S)} $$.

[Suffix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree) can be constructed from suffix array in linear time.  
A few things:  
1. Internal nodes store pointers only.
2. External nodes store corresponding starting positions.
3. Edges store (shared) suffix along the paths.

__App:__ Suffix Array has good performance in finding the exact match. suffix tree can be viewed as an extension of suffix array as it has good performance with tolerance to mismatch.  

### Tries

__Dictionary Problem:__ query of a word in a collection of words. HashMap is not very useful here because it is easy to run out of memory if the collection is large.

[Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) is the go-to data structure to provide spatially and temporally efficient query. Originally, every node in a trie holds one character. That generates a lot of node that only has one child. So we use one node holding a string to substitude a chain of one-child nodes holding one character, which makes it a __compressed trie__.  

In case we have a large size of alphabet, we would need to go through a large number of comparisons for each step. This is not efficient so we can use a HashMap to store pointers to children rather than using an array.
