#### Why B tree

__Problem__  
If we represent a list of numbers in the form of a binary search tree and want to find all the numbers within some given range. We will do the following:  

``` python
def rangeQuery(L, R, root):
  if L < root.val:
    rangeQuery(L, R, root.left)
  if L <= root.val <= R:
    output root.val
  if root.val < R:
    rangeQuery(L, R, root.right)
```

__External Memory Model of Analysis__  
In the case when the data is __so large__ that we have to store them on disk, with each node taking a block of memory (the size of B words with some large constant B), each traversing step would be very expansive. In situations like this, we cannot use normal approach to do data structure performance analysis, because all the in-memory operations are free compared to transferring memory block from/to secondary storage. We will use external memory model analysis where we count the number of transfers.  

Following the above, the algorithm takes $$ O(log{n} + \;outputSize\;) $$ with outputSize be potentially as large as n.  

This is __where B tree came in__:
1. Each node stores [B/2, B] keys.
2. Each transfer of block brings in at most B keys for us to check.
3. If we ever need to traverse to another node, we must have outputted all the keys in the current node.  

It givens $$ O(log{n} + \frac{\;outputSize\;}{B}) $$ I/O complexity.  

#### B tree

__Properties:__
1. Inorder traversal produces sorted results.
2. No external nodes in B tree.
3. All leaves are at the same level.
4. Level: $$ \log_{B}{n} $$
5. Each node has [B/2, B] keys, except that root can have a single key.

#### Operation

__Insert(X)__
```
find where X should be
if there are less than B keys:
  add X
else:
  split this node at the median key (median of X and the other B keys) into two trees. One being the left child of the median node. The other being the right child.
  insert the median key to this node's parent
  # it would keep going up if the parent node at every level is full
  # if it is still full at the root level, median node will emerge as the new on-key root.
```
